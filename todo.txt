thing to do:

[x] you can die
[x] enemies fight back during combat
[x] enemies only follow you if they can see you \ have seen you recently \ are close
[x] fewer dead-end ladders
[x] player can level up somehow (climb a ladder on level 1)
[x] enemies drop gold, display on hud
[x] enemies level up as you go deeper
[x] walking potions

definitely:
[x] heal in town
[x] better fx when an enemy is killed - it must stay on screen until the next action
	and show what loot you got

-post ggj-
[x] Transmission spell gives directions to the boss! Who is transmitting radio 
[x] Killing a boss reveals some story which helps you know to find the tree 
[x] healing is unaffordable after levelling up
[x] top ladders colored differently
[x] gold drops randomly - TEST DROPS FROM NORMALS AND BOSSES
[x] color mode picker
[x] aging when you study - it's purely a text thing
[x] spells
[x] spell UI
[x] unlock different spells
[x] player shows as arrow on map
[x] spell details screen [s]
[x] color pallete swapper
[x] don't show enemies on map
[x] fix looping levels after the bottom
[x] draw order - a ladder is drawn before a wall that should be closer
[x] heartbeat is too good re ritual, it's always better and should be a risk\reward thing - matt
[x] study cost
	- cost 83, i have 153 and i healed once
	- cost 166, i have 289
	- it should probaly cost a little more
[x] add music (sergio fb chat)
[x] no looping below bottom of dungeon
[x] end game victory - the potplant
[x] clues
[x] spells unlock too fast - sergio ++++
	could unlock at 1/2 the rate
[x] iron giant level 4 - v slow, i got 6 attacks and killed it before it fought back. ok? could it have more health so it gets a hit off
[x] everything this deep is a bit slow imo - some enemies should be as fast as the player - untested :/ :/
[x] move enemies when you fall onto them from a ladder - sergio (is right)
	(not fixed but should be super rare now)

more:
[x] draw islands under water ladders and potion bearers <---
[x] give more exp - sergio (== threshholds lower).
[x] more gold? (err make it more consistent)
[x] potion bearers miss too often
[x] level up text should be white, not grey
[x] shuffle monster positions after studying
[x] random regen spell points
[x] touch controls + wasd
[x] remove glitch to revive after death by pressing 's'

even more:
[x] save the game (local storage)
[x] fix layout on small screens
[x] speed up saving on later levels (it's the enemies)
[x] mouse hover effect
[x] extinction spell - permanent cost?! kills everyone EXCEPT the target

a:
[x] bosses must not spawn in unreachable rooms. flood fill test the whole dungeon!
[x] make dungeon different on each life
[x] complete the set of spells
	[x] teleport should teleport the monster, not you - that's much more useful. (can no longer be used to reach bosses though)
	[x] err maybe it's both - with no target, it teleports you!
	[x] deception
	[x] oroboros
[x] pits
[x] spawn player near center
[x] plant should not be drawn in shadow sprite
[x] killing the oxygen generator seems too hacky
[x] reset \ delete save \ save manager
[x] ceiling on lower trash levels
[x] improve \ clarify the main quest
[x] rebalance

saturday playtest:
90m - got to level 7. It's hard to get to 8. Died.
[x] It was mostly fine except i didn't get enough XP to level up by the time i ran out of spell points
[x] i'd like 0.5x XP from low level enemies, same at level 4, more from there on
[x] enemy defence, speed and power should not scale with level. The player's stats don't!
[x] *** level up costs: was cheap up to level 5, but 5->6 is too expensive for the first time. should be $300 max
[x] low level enemies too slow - high level enemies too fast
[x] tentacles have v high defence - less hp to compensate? like, 4-5hp
[x] enemies feel too tough on level 5+. I am level 7 but dungeon depth 7 is really hard for me
[x] iron giant - even more health?
[x] fill background in black so save-as-image takes screenshots correctly
[x] wedge of cheese - didn't do plural correctly for 1 hp
[x] push enemies you step onto (via ladder or wall-walk)
[x] i don't notice spells unlock
[x] full screen map

sunday playtest
[ ] ladders are not fixed in space correctly - must be centered on center of the hole
[ ] down ladders clip through walls - 2 pixels too low?

[ ] game is too easy if you get too many upgrades
[x] too much gold at around level 8 - ui clipping
[x] earthstar never hit me
[x] luck potions do not work
[ ] you don't fall through a pit you land on via a pit
[ ] (move enemies when you pitfall onto them)
[ ] stack repeated attacks from the same enemy

show tips?
use space to wait to get first strike
watch your health! Health is like fuel, save half of it for the journey home!
save some spell points to help you get out of trouble
understanding potions is the most important skill in the game!
maybe: if you're deeper than you should be, stay close to a downwards ladder - if you fall down a pit, you can climb it back up


[ ] poison - sporangium, bee, trash?
[ ] fog of war
[ ] help text

Moraff's help text in lower right:
"If you see something in the left or right view, press one of the arrow keys to turn around so it appears in the main view."
"How to play: use arrow keys to explore the dungeon. Use ladders to descend to deeper, more dangerous places"
"You are in the town! Each colored square on the map is a ladder gonig up to to [sic] an inn, temple, bank or store"
u => "there is no ladder here in this square. if you see a ladder in one of the views, ..."
"on the left is a map showing the are around you. slanted lines show ladders going up and down"

[ ] top level, no enemies (banana peels?)
[ ] 'what do we do now' - remove a monster's urge to kill. it won't attach unless provoked
	(if the current version is too powerful, this would be a good alternative)
[ ] potions - less frequent? (1/20 of enemies in moraffs)
[ ] metrics
[ ] ? pass through enemies spell (you swap places)
[ ] ? oroborus - you can use sp as hp if you are killed
[ ] speed up performance on slow devices - DrawWall obviously, but also drawMap's use of anyAtCell and general overdrawing
[ ] grey the stats text
[ ] extinction spell?
[ ] once we have pits - bottom floor should have 'fallen' enemies from earlier levels, still at lower level
[ ] spell to ignore pits

old:
[ ] Get out of trouble spells must be: the cheaper the worse. 
[ ] Waves or what do we do now could be an instant drop downwards - its' cheap but risky
	expensive powers should deal with multiple encounters
	i.e. boost a stat for 20 turns, slowly regenerate health, resist disease for a while
	Power to disable one enemy only | Power to disable all enemies 
	Poison as a countdown to get to the surface - do i run or cast cure poison, it's a tough decision
	Ascend spells are too good if you can use in combat (get out of any trouble instantly)


spell thoughts:
i only use healing - matt
final spell to be renamed (short name) to either "problems" or "each other" depending on what we decide it should do
sergio wants instant death resistance
what do we do now - enemy joins your party, comes along and attacks with you
[ ] the damage spell should be strong enough to get you out of a tough situation
[ ] seeing monsters on map would be a useful power
[ ] invisibility and teleport kinda solve the same problem?
	resist specific attacks - poison, ice
	waves - temporarily upgrade speed, that's versatile (and different from invisibility)
[ ] health go red when low?!
[ ] let the player dig downwards (if they get stuck) (we've never needed this)

unlikely:
[ ] cryptocurrencies
[ ] nice error messages on invalid actions
[ ] mouse controls
[ ] balance the whole game
[ ] better pathfinding (flood fill)
