thing to do:

[x] you can die
[x] enemies fight back during combat
[x] enemies only follow you if they can see you \ have seen you recently \ are close
[x] fewer dead-end ladders
[x] player can level up somehow (climb a ladder on level 1)
[x] enemies drop gold, display on hud
[x] enemies level up as you go deeper
[x] walking potions

definitely:
[x] heal in town
[x] better fx when an enemy is killed - it must stay on screen until the next action
	and show what loot you got

-post ggj-
[x] Transmission spell gives directions to the boss! Who is transmitting radio 
[x] Killing a boss reveals some story which helps you know to find the tree 
[x] healing is unaffordable after levelling up
[x] top ladders colored differently
[x] gold drops randomly - TEST DROPS FROM NORMALS AND BOSSES
[x] color mode picker
[x] aging when you study - it's purely a text thing
[x] spells
[x] spell UI
[x] unlock different spells
[x] player shows as arrow on map
[x] spell details screen [s]
[x] color pallete swapper
[x] don't show enemies on map
[x] fix looping levels after the bottom
[x] draw order - a ladder is drawn before a wall that should be closer
[x] heartbeat is too good re ritual, it's always better and should be a risk\reward thing - matt
[x] study cost
	- cost 83, i have 153 and i healed once
	- cost 166, i have 289
	- it should probaly cost a little more
[x] add music (sergio fb chat)
[x] no looping below bottom of dungeon

[ ] spells unlock too fast - sergio ++++
	could unlock at 1/2 or 1/3 the rate (make it less random)
[ ] pits
[ ] announce when on boss level
[ ] better spells




[ ] Get out of trouble spells must be: the cheaper the worse. 
[ ] Waves or what do we do now should be an instant drop downwards! Cheap escape 
	Power to disable one enemy only | Power to disable all enemies 
	Poison as a countdown to get to the surface - or cast cure poison, it's a tough decision
	Ascent spell is too good if you can use in combat (get out of any trouble instantly)

[ ] poison - sporangium, bee, trash?
[ ] end game victory - the potplant
[ ] fog of war
[ ] full screen map
[ ] health drops from monsters (makes healing spell more debatable)
[ ] move enemies when you fall onto them from a ladder - sergio (is right)
iron giant level 4 - v slow, i got 6 attacks and killed it before it fought back. ok?
[ ] everything here (water level) is a bit slow imo - should be 1/2 player speed on average. some things should be faster

spell thoughts:
i only use healing - matt
final spell to be renamed (short name) to either "problems" or "each other" depending on what we decide it should do
sergio wants instant death resistance
[ ] the damage spell should be strong enough to get you out of a tough situation
[ ] seeing monsters on map would be a useful power
[ ] invisibility and teleport kinda solve the same problem?
	we need spells that don't all solve the same problem!
	maybe have some prep spells vs combat spells
	an ascend spell would be useful, but shouldn't work in combat or it trumps combat spells
	defeat 1 monster vs defeat many monsters at more risk
	resist specific attacks - poison, ice
	waves - temporarily upgrade speed, that's versatile (and different from invisibility)

[ ] health go red when low?!
[ ] let the player dig downwards (if they get stuck) (we've never needed this)
[ ] more spells
[ ] save the game (local storage)

unlikely:
[ ] cryptocurrencies
[ ] nice error messages on invalid actions
[ ] mouse controls
[ ] balance the whole game
[ ] better pathfinding (flood fill)
[ ] more random drops from monsters

maybe
[ ] fix bosses stuck in unreachable rooms
[ ] healing probably gets too expensive, keep the price constant
[ ] make more spells work
