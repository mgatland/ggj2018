thing to do:

[x] you can die
[x] enemies fight back during combat
[x] enemies only follow you if they can see you \ have seen you recently \ are close
[x] fewer dead-end ladders
[x] player can level up somehow (climb a ladder on level 1)
[x] enemies drop gold, display on hud
[x] enemies level up as you go deeper
[x] walking potions

definitely:
[x] heal in town
[x] better fx when an enemy is killed - it must stay on screen until the next action
	and show what loot you got

-post ggj-
[x] Transmission spell gives directions to the boss! Who is transmitting radio 
[x] Killing a boss reveals some story which helps you know to find the tree 
[x] healing is unaffordable after levelling up
[x] top ladders colored differently
[x] gold drops randomly - TEST DROPS FROM NORMALS AND BOSSES
[x] color mode picker
[x] aging when you study - it's purely a text thing
[x] spells
[x] spell UI
[x] unlock different spells
[x] player shows as arrow on map
[x] spell details screen [s]
[x] color pallete swapper
[x] don't show enemies on map
[x] fix looping levels after the bottom
[x] draw order - a ladder is drawn before a wall that should be closer

[ ] move enemies when you fall onto them form a ladder - sergio (is right)
[ ] add music (sergio fb chat)
[ ] poison enemies? or level drainers
[ ] study cost
- cost 83, i have 153 and i healed once
- cost 166, i have 289
- it should probaly cost a little more, check gold drop vs experience drop
iron giant level 4 - v slow, i got 6 attacks and killed it before it fought back. ok?
[ ] everything here (water level) is a bit slow imo - should be 1/2 player speed on average. some things should be faster

spell thoughts:
1. i only use healing - matt
2. unlock too fast - sergio ++++
	could unlock at 1/2 or 1/3 the rate (make it less random)
3. heartbeat is too good re ritual, it's always better and should be a risk\reward thing - matt
4. final spell to be renamed (short name) to either "problems" or "each other" depending on what we decide it should do
5. sergio wants instant death resistance
[ ] the damage spell should be strong enough to get you out of a tough situation
[ ] seeing monsters on map would be useful
[ ] invisibility and teleport kinda solve the same problem?
	we need spells that don't all solve the same problem!
	maybe have some prep spells vs combat spells
	an ascend spell would be useful, but shouldn't work in combat or it trumps combat spells
	defeat 1 monster vs defeat many monsters at more risk
	resist specific attacks - poison, ice
	waves - temporarily upgrade speed, that's versatile (and different from invisibility)

[ ] health go red when low?!
[ ] announce when on boss level
[ ] interesting enemies - i.e. a slow one with lots of health, a poison one
[ ] poison - sporangium, bee, trash?
[ ] let the player dig downwards (if they get stuck)
[ ] end game victory - the potplant - no looping below bottom of dungeon
[ ] fog of war
[ ] full screen map
[ ] more spells

unlikely:
[ ] cryptocurrencies
[ ] nice error messages on invalid actions
[ ] mouse controls

[ ] balance the whole game
[ ] better pathfinding (flood fill)
[ ] more random drops from monsters

maybe
[ ] fix bosses stuck in unreachable rooms
[ ] healing probably gets too expensive, keep the price constant
[ ] make more spells work
[ ] save the game (local storage)
