thing to do:

[x] you can die
[x] enemies fight back during combat
[x] enemies only follow you if they can see you \ have seen you recently \ are close
[x] fewer dead-end ladders
[x] player can level up somehow (climb a ladder on level 1)
[x] enemies drop gold, display on hud
[x] enemies level up as you go deeper

[ ] better fx when an enemy is killed - it must stay on screen until the next action
	and show what loot you got
[ ] walking potions

[ ] heal in town

[ ] spells

[ ] cryptocurrencies
