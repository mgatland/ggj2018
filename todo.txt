thing to do:

[x] you can die
[x] enemies fight back during combat
[x] enemies only follow you if they can see you \ have seen you recently \ are close
[x] fewer dead-end ladders
[x] player can level up somehow (climb a ladder on level 1)
[x] enemies drop gold, display on hud
[x] enemies level up as you go deeper
[x] walking potions

definitely:
[x] heal in town
[x] better fx when an enemy is killed - it must stay on screen until the next action
	and show what loot you got

[ ] spells
[x] spell UI
[x] unlock different spells
[x] spell details screen [s]

[ ] color pallete swapper

maybe:
[ ] end game victory
[ ] fog of war
[ ] player shows as arrow on map
[ ] bosses

unlikely:
[ ] cryptocurrencies
[ ] nice error messages on invalid actions
[ ] mouse controls
[ ] full screen map
