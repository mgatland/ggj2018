thing to do:

[x] you can die
[x] enemies fight back during combat
[x] enemies only follow you if they can see you \ have seen you recently \ are close
[x] fewer dead-end ladders
[x] player can level up somehow (climb a ladder on level 1)
[x] enemies drop gold, display on hud
[x] enemies level up as you go deeper
[x] walking potions

definitely:
[x] heal in town
[x] better fx when an enemy is killed - it must stay on screen until the next action
	and show what loot you got

-post ggj-
[x] Transmission spell gives directions to the boss! Who is transmitting radio 
[x] Killing a boss reveals some story which helps you know to find the tree 
[x] healing is unaffordable after levelling up
[x] top ladders colored differently
[x] gold drops randomly - TEST DROPS FROM NORMALS AND BOSSES
[x] color mode picker
[x] aging when you study - it's purely a text thing
[x] spells
[x] spell UI
[x] unlock different spells
[x] player shows as arrow on map
[x] spell details screen [s]
[x] color pallete swapper
[x] don't show enemies on map
[x] fix looping levels after the bottom

maybe:
[ ] announce when on boss level
[ ] draw order - a ladder is drawn before a wall that should be closer
[ ] let the player dig downwards (if they get stuck)
[ ] end game victory - the potplant
[ ] fog of war
[ ] bosses

unlikely:
[ ] cryptocurrencies
[ ] nice error messages on invalid actions
[ ] mouse controls
[ ] full screen map

[ ] balance the whole game
[ ] full screen map button
[ ] better pathfinding (flood fill)
[ ] more random drops from monsters

maybe
[ ] fix bosses stuck in unreachable rooms
[ ] healing probably gets too expensive, keep the price constant
[ ] make more spells work
[ ] save the game (local storage)
