thing to do:

[x] you can die
[x] enemies fight back during combat
[x] enemies only follow you if they can see you \ have seen you recently \ are close
[x] fewer dead-end ladders
[x] player can level up somehow (climb a ladder on level 1)
[x] enemies drop gold, display on hud
[x] enemies level up as you go deeper
[x] walking potions

definitely:
[x] heal in town
[x] better fx when an enemy is killed - it must stay on screen until the next action
	and show what loot you got

-post ggj-
[x] Transmission spell gives directions to the boss! Who is transmitting radio 
[x] Killing a boss reveals some story which helps you know to find the tree 
[x] healing is unaffordable after levelling up
[x] top ladders colored differently
[x] gold drops randomly - TEST DROPS FROM NORMALS AND BOSSES
[x] color mode picker
[x] aging when you study - it's purely a text thing
[x] spells
[x] spell UI
[x] unlock different spells
[x] player shows as arrow on map
[x] spell details screen [s]
[x] color pallete swapper
[x] don't show enemies on map
[x] fix looping levels after the bottom
[x] draw order - a ladder is drawn before a wall that should be closer
[x] heartbeat is too good re ritual, it's always better and should be a risk\reward thing - matt
[x] study cost
	- cost 83, i have 153 and i healed once
	- cost 166, i have 289
	- it should probaly cost a little more
[x] add music (sergio fb chat)
[x] no looping below bottom of dungeon
[x] end game victory - the potplant
[x] clues
[x] spells unlock too fast - sergio ++++
	could unlock at 1/2 the rate
[x] iron giant level 4 - v slow, i got 6 attacks and killed it before it fought back. ok? could it have more health so it gets a hit off
[x] everything this deep is a bit slow imo - some enemies should be as fast as the player - untested :/ :/
[x] move enemies when you fall onto them from a ladder - sergio (is right)
	(not fixed but should be super rare now)

more:
[x] draw islands under water ladders and potion bearers <---
[x] give more exp - sergio (== threshholds lower).
[x] more gold? (err make it more consistent)
[x] potion bearers miss too often
[x] level up text should be white, not grey
[x] shuffle monster positions after studying
[x] random regen spell points
[x] touch controls + wasd
[x] remove glitch to revive after death by pressing 's'

even more:
[x] save the game (local storage)
[x] fix layout on small screens
[x] speed up saving on later levels (it's the enemies)

[ ] metrics
[ ] extinction spell - permanent cost?! kills everyone EXCEPT the target
[ ] require a click to focus
[ ] ? pass through enemies spell (you swap places)
[ ] ? oroborus - you can use sp as hp if you are killed


[ ] speed up performance on slow devices - DrawWall obviously, but also drawMap's use of anyAtCell and general overdrawing
[ ] fix touch controls (preventDefault and on touch down)
[ ] grey the stats text
[ ] improve \ clarify the main quest

[ ] ceiling on lower trash levels
[ ] make dungeon different on each life
[ ] extinction spell?
[ ] plant should not be drawn in shadow sprite
[ ] killing the oxygen generator seems too hacky
[ ] top level, no enemies (banana peels?)
[ ] once we have pits - bottom floor should have 'fallen' enemies from earlier levels, still at lower level
[ ] spell to ignore pits

old:
[ ] pits
[ ] better spells

[ ] Get out of trouble spells must be: the cheaper the worse. 
[ ] Waves or what do we do now could be an instant drop downwards - its' cheap but risky
	expensive powers should deal with multiple encounters
	i.e. boost a stat for 20 turns, slowly regenerate health, resist disease for a while
	Power to disable one enemy only | Power to disable all enemies 
	Poison as a countdown to get to the surface - do i run or cast cure poison, it's a tough decision
	Ascend spells are too good if you can use in combat (get out of any trouble instantly)

[ ] poison - sporangium, bee, trash?

[ ] fog of war
[ ] full screen map
[ ] health drops from monsters (makes using a healing spell more debatable)


spell thoughts:
i only use healing - matt
final spell to be renamed (short name) to either "problems" or "each other" depending on what we decide it should do
sergio wants instant death resistance
[ ] the damage spell should be strong enough to get you out of a tough situation
[ ] seeing monsters on map would be a useful power
[ ] invisibility and teleport kinda solve the same problem?
	resist specific attacks - poison, ice
	waves - temporarily upgrade speed, that's versatile (and different from invisibility)
[ ] health go red when low?!
[ ] let the player dig downwards (if they get stuck) (we've never needed this)

unlikely:
[ ] cryptocurrencies
[ ] nice error messages on invalid actions
[ ] mouse controls
[ ] balance the whole game
[ ] better pathfinding (flood fill)
[ ] more random drops from monsters

maybe
[ ] fix bosses stuck in unreachable rooms
[ ] healing probably gets too expensive, keep the price constant
[ ] make more spells work
